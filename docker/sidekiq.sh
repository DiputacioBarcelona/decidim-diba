# The following is simpler but sidekiq is executed as root and the files it creates are also created as root:root,
# this causes permissions problems when passenger tries to access files in tmp/ that were generated by sidekiq processes,
# mainly in /tmp/cache

# bundle exec sidekiq -d -L "log/sidekiq.log" -e production -C config/sidekiq.yml
